&lt;p>So, I&amp;rsquo;m going to document them here. Keep a journal of projects I do (mostly
programming and home improvement), books and lectures I get to finish.
There&amp;rsquo;s something very satisfying about keeping a log of
little accomplishments, akin to crossing out a task on a to-do list.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hoping that in a few years from now I&amp;rsquo;ll look at this and be &amp;ldquo;wow! made
some progress!&amp;rdquo;. But there&amp;rsquo;s a high probability that it will die just like
dozens of other devs' personal websites I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, that
get resurrected once in a while when they&amp;rsquo;re applying for jobs.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
