When things are not documented, it's like they never happened.


So, I'm going to document them here. Keep a journal of projects I do (mostly
programming and home improvement), books and lectures I get to finish.
There's something very satisfying about keeping a log of
little accomplishments, akin to crossing out a task on a to-do list.


Hoping that in a few years from now I'll look at this and be "wow! made
some progress!". But there's a high probability that it will die just like
dozens of other devs' personal websites I've seen, that
get resurrected once in a while when they're applying for jobs.
