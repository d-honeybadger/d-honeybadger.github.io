Finished an awesome [lecture series on distributed systems
by Martin Kleppmann](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKd45zvjcDFUEv_ohr_HdUFe97RItdiB),
which shines some light on fancy words like eventual consistency and consensus.


It starts with the foundations, like clocks and timestamps, synchronization,
various kinds of message broadcast, and builds up on all that to explain
consensus algorithms, two-phase commits, linearizability.
There's a lot of pseudocode and very little handwaving.
