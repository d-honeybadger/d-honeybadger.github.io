,
which shines some light on fancy words like eventual consistency and consensus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It starts with the foundations, like clocks and timestamps, synchronization,
various kinds of message broadcast, and builds up on all that to explain
consensus algorithms, two-phase commits, linearizability.
There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of pseudocode and very little handwaving.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>And so the log begins</title><link>https://d-honeybadger.github.io/posts/2021-04-03_hello_dashalog/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 23:08:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://d-honeybadger.github.io/posts/2021-04-03_hello_dashalog/</guid><description>&lt;p>When things are not documented, it&amp;rsquo;s like they never happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I&amp;rsquo;m going to document them here. Keep a journal of projects I do (mostly
programming and home improvement), books and lectures I get to finish.

&lt;p>Hoping that in a few years from now I&amp;rsquo;ll look at this and be &amp;ldquo;wow! made
some progress!&amp;rdquo;. But there&amp;rsquo;s a high probability that it will die just like
dozens of other devs' personal websites I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, that
get resurrected once in a while when they&amp;rsquo;re applying for jobs.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
